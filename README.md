Bondage Club Auto React (BCAR)
====================  
This Extension lets your Character react automatically to Actions done to them.

The ears will wiggle too. To change the ears for the wiggle animation see "Registration of Ears" down below. You can add the script via Tampermoney here [Link](./script/BCARLoader.user.js)  
or add it as Bookmark any of your devices. To do that save  <code>javascript:(()=>{fetch('https://drbranestawm.github.io/autoReact/script/BCAR.js').then(r=>r.text()).then(r=>eval(r));})();</code> as a bookmark on your devices.

Registration of Ears
----------------------
Currently the only way to change the ears type is to use chat commands. And it has to be done each time the game is reloaded.

  - /bcar ear1 : To save your current ears as the primary ear.

Switch your ear to the one you want the secondary ear to be.

  - /bcar ear2 : To save the secondary ears.
